## Tech

Jams is a monorepo project, built using npm Workspaces, and consists of two packages: app and server.

Frontend:

- The frontend was developed using React and Vite.
- Vite was chosen for its fast development server and efficient build process, enhancing the development experience.

Backend:

- The backend was built using Node.js, chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it well-suited for handling asynchronous operations like API requests.
- Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, is used for routing and middleware management.

Authentication and Security:

- To handle user authentication securely, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are employed. JWT provides a stateless authentication mechanism and allows for secure transmission of data between parties.
- The use of JWT helps negate the need for a traditional database, enhancing scalability and reducing complexity.
- Sensitive user data, such as Spotify credentials, is securely handled using JWT.
